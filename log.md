### Day 1: July 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started with hackerRank Challenge and Harvard's scalability videos. 

**Thoughts:** Harvard's scalability video is the starting point for the system design interview learning. It is fascinating to learn how big social site like facebook has solved the problem related to scalability of the system.
Also, I wanted to solve algorithmic problem.
