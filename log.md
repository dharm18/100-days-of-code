**Today's Progress**: Taken up the challenge and prepared the starting point. 

**Thoughts:** I really wanted to revise concepts that I have learnt in last few years. So, I think this is right time to do.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
